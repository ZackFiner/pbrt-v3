# Sampling specification: PBRT will shoot 256 samples rays per pixel.
# Increasing the number of samples per pixel will increase image quality

# Integrator specification: PBRT will compute a single bounce of light.
# Increasing maxdepth increases the bounces of light computed, and will
# drastically increase the noise of the final image. To decrease noise,
# increase the pixelsamples of the sampler above
